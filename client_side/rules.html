<h1>Game play</h1>

<p>The game takes place over 3 rounds. To start a round, all players simultaneously choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep and place it in their row. When each player has done this turn ends. </p>

<p>After each turn you pass your remaining hand to clockwise. Everyone picks up their new hands and the next turn begins. You now have a new and smaller hand to
choose from.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Cards in your row remain with you until the end of the round, when they are scored.</p>

<h3>Using Wasabi</h3>
<p>If you choose a squid, salmon or egg nigiri card, and already have a wasabi card in front of you, this is to show that the nigiri 
has been dipped in wasabi and has tripled in value!</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You may have multiple wasabi cards in front of you but only 1 nigiri card may be placed after each wasabi card.</p>


<h2>Ending a round</h2>

<p>The final remaining card of each hand is passed on. (Often this final card wonâ€™t be of much use, but sometimes an
unfortunate player will be forced to leave you with something valuable).</p>

<br>
<h2>Scoring</h2>

<h3>Maki Rolls</h3>

<p>Each player adds up the maki roll icons at the top of all their maki roll cards. The player with the most icons scores 6 points. If multiple players tie for the most, they split the 6 points
evenly (ignoring any remainder) and no second place points are awarded.</p>

<p>The player with the second most icons scores 3 points. If multiple players tie for second place, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).</p>




<img src="Images/tempura.png" class="floatr">
<h3>Tempura</h3>
<p>A set of 2 tempura cards scores 5 points.</p>
<p>A single tempura card is worth nothing. You may score multiple sets of tempura in a round.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/sashimi.png" class="floatr">
<h3>Sashimi</h3>
<p>A set of 3 sashimi cards scores 10 points.</p>
<p>A single sashimi card or a set of only 2 is worth nothing. You may score multiple sets of sashimi in a round, although this is very hard to do.</p>
<br>

<img src="Images/dumpling.png" class="floatr">
<h3>Dumplings</h3>
<p>The more dumpling cards you have, the more points you will score.</p>

<h3>Nigiri and wasabi</h3>

<p>A squid nigiri scores 3 points. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 9 points.</p>
<p>A salmon nigiri scores 2 points. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 6 points.</p>
<p>An egg nigiri scores 1 point. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 3 points.</p>
<p>A wasabi card with no nigiri on it scores nothing.</p>








<br>
<h2>Starting a new round</h2>

<p>Your score after each round will be displayed on your left.</p>
<p>New hand is dealt for each player</p>

<br>
<h2>End of the game</h2>

<p>After the third round is scored, Pudding cards are now scored.</p>


<h3>Puddings</h3>

<img src="Images/pudding.png" class="floatr">

<p>The player with the most pudding cards scores 6 points. If multiple players tie for the most, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).</p>
<p>The player with the fewest pudding cards (including players with none) loses 6 points.</p>
<p>If multiple players tie for the least, they split the lost points evenly (ignoring any remainder).</p>


<p>Whoever has the most points after 3 rounds is the winner. In case of a tie, whoever has the most pudding cards wins!</p>
