# TeamSoftware
The main deliverable of the project is an online multi-player game that can be played (online) with at least 4 different players (it is up to you to decide the upper limit for the number of players). Rather than inventing a new game, it is strongly advised to implement an existing game, though game improvements and additions could be made. Also, it is advised to implement a turn-based game, rather than realtime games such as DOOM or Quake (or insert modern equivalent here). Semi-realtime games include Transport Tycoon, SimCity, and Command & Conquer (and similar games, starting with Dune 2 in the 1990s); all of these feature animation. Examples of turn-based games are:

    Risk
    Monopoly
    Battle Ship (originally to be played by only 2 players)
    Ludo
    Poker


Obviously, some games are more straightforward (Ludo, Poker) than others (Risk, Monopoly). A simpler game can still lead to a maximum score, but this would require paying more attention to gameplay (music, graphics, etc.). Likewise, a more complex game doesn't automatically lead to a higher mark, if the implementation is simple (e.g. low-quality graphics). (It should be clear that this project is not to test your graphical design skills, but drawing characters like square blocks won't sell your game, for example).

The software/game itself will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

    Gameplay
    Quality / cleanness of the code
    Software architecture & design

We will be implementing the cardgame Sushi Go!
Sushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of "draft and pass" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!
